1 - Silver : 
	- there is a typo in the dispersion relation. 
	- check the epsilon with Eduardo paper (#370) . 
	- update the long version of overlaf. Try VIM. Resolution of problems: 
		- for the Pscat_n : it was not changing with "n" because I was not using the 
			correct values for omega, a and N that give a real angle theta
		- ... keep thinking for more items 

2 - hBN : increase the loss to reduce the divergence (problem with the numerical expression)
